  "notes": "This software implements the SYNTH-v2 configuration that achieves 6/6 self-evidence criteria within a narrow stress regime (3.9× damage multiplier ± 5%). Key contribution: demonstrates that self-like functional identity is achievable in artificial systems, but requires specific mechanisms and calibrated conditions."
